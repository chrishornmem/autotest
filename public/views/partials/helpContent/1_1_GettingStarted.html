<h4>1.1&nbsp&nbspGetting Started</h4>
<p>ONEm Simulator relies on <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON files</a> that control the service flow, user input and output. The simulator executes only one JSON file at a time and from top to bottom. The simulator infers the JSON file to execute based on the user's input.
</p>
<p>
    A good working knowledge of JSON is assumed, it is strongly recommended that the reader gets familiar with the concepts of JSON before attempting to create or modify services.
</p>
<p><strong>1.1.1 JSON File selection & service switching</strong></p>
<p>In ONEm services, users switch to a particular service using the # prefix immediately followed by the service name, eg #weather. ONEmSimulator converts '#weather' to the file path '/weather/index.json' and attempts to execute a file with that name. The table below gives exmaples:</p>
<pre>
    <table class="table table-condensed">
        <thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Command</th>
				<th>Path + file</th>
			</tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>#</td>
				<td>/index.json</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>#onem</td>
				<td>/onem.json</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>#contacts</td>
				<td>/contacts/index.json</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>#post add</td>
				<td>/post/add.json</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>#contacts add chris</td>
				<td>/contacts/add/chris.json</td>
			</tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

<p><strong>1.1.2 Your first service</strong></p>
<p>Let's create a very simple service.  Using the ONEmSimulator files tab, create a folder named <code>profile</code> under the root folder.  And create a file named <code>index.json</code> under the newly created folder.  To create the file, take a copy of another file from a different folder.</p>

<p>The example file below creates a service called <code>#profile</code> and asks the user to enter their first name.  After capturing the user's first name, the simulator automatically takes the user to the <code>#onem</code> menu.</p>
<pre>
{
    "content": [{
        "ref": "/profile/index.json",
        "type": "input",
        "menuRef": "/profile/menu.json",
        "header": "** #profile **",
        "content": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "What is your first name?"
        }
    }, {
        "type": "end",
        "ref": "#onem"
    }]
}
</pre>

<p>Let's examine the JSON more closely.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, every JSON file must being with "{" and end with "}"</li>
<li>Every ONEmSimulator JSON file must begin with "content": [{" which creates an array of objects.</li>
<li><code>ref</code> is optional and is used in the log tab only at the time of writing.  It is however recommended to always include this as it serves as a useful reminder as to which file is currently being edited and executed.  Note that the value of <code>ref</code> is not validated, it is purely for informational purposes.</li>
<li><code>type</code> is mandatory.  It is used to inform the simulator to determine the current context, ie what type of input is expected next by the user and what type of output to display.  In this case, we are telling the simulator that the user can type any input, at this point we are not storing the input, the simulator will simply allow the user to type anything (except for reserved verbs or service switch commands which are handled in a special way.</li>
<li><code>menuRef</code> is optional.  This tells the simulator to watch for the "menu" verb and to switch context to another JSON file (or service) if the user sends "menu".  So in this example, if the user sends <code>"menu"</code>, the simulator will switch context, ie jump out of the current file, and execute the file <code>/profile/menu.json</code></li>
<li><code>header</code> is optional.  It tells the simulator to output a header with the specified text</li>
<li><code>content</code> is required by the <code>"input"</code> property.  In this case, content is an object containing the string to output to the user.  Note the <code>"type": "string"</code>, which at the time of writing is not used, but it's presence is recommended for future forwards compatibility.</li>
<li>The next two lines "} and "}, {" close off the first input object and open a second object in the content array.  So up to this point, the simulator knows to output a string called "What is your first name?" and wait for any input.</li>
<li><code>end</code> is mandatory, although it might not always be executed as we shall see later.  The <code>end</code> property tells the simulator what JSON file to execute if it reaches the end of the file.  So in this case, after the user has entered their first name, the simulator will execute the next JSON object in the "content" array.  The <code>end</code> property is required in this case to tell the simulator where to go next.  Note that in this case, we have used the "service switch" naming convention <code>#onem</code> to inform the simulator to switch to the <code>#onem</code> service.  We could have equally validly written <code>/onem.json</code> instead.
</li>The last two lines "}]" and "}" close off the content array as well as close off the JSON file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let's try executing the #profile service</p>

<p>Send <code>#profile</code> and you should see the following</p>
<pre>
** #profile **
What is your first name?
<send option>
</pre>

<p>After entering your name, you should see the <code>#onem</code> menu.</p>
<p>Now try <code>#profile</code> again and this time send "menu" in response and see what happens.</p>

<p>Congratulations, now you have created your first service, start exploring the JSON property reference</p>
