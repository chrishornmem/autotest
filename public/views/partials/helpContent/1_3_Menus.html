<h4>1.3&nbsp&nbspMenus</h4>
<p>All good ONEm services have menus at their heart.  So let's extend our profile service to include a menu.</p>
<pre>
{
    "content": [{
        "ref": "/profile/index.json",
        "type": "input",
        "menuRef": "/profile/menu.json",
        "header": "** #profile **",
        "content": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "What is your first name?"
        }
<strong>    }, {
        "menuRef": "profile/menu.json",
        "type": "menu",
       	"header": "** #profile menu **\nWhat is your favourite colour?",
        "content": [{
            "ref": "profile/red.json",
            "type": "linkStatic",
            "shortcut": "red",
            "description": "I like red"
        }, {
            "ref": "profile/blue.json",
            "type": "linkStatic",
            "shortcut": "blue",
            "description": "I prefer blue"
        }, {
            "type": "skip",
            "shortcut": "skip",
            "description": "skip"
        }]
    },
</strong>    {
    	"type": "end",
    	"ref": "#onem"
    }]
}
</pre>
<p>Let's now examine the newly inserted menu lines</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>menuRef</code> does the same job as before.  It's duplicated here again (as well as being present within the <code>input</code> property) to have the flexibility to refer to a different JSON file if the user types "menu" whilst within the context of this menu.</li>
<li><code>type menu</code> indicates to the simulator that a menu follows.  The simulator expects to see a sub-property of type content, which we will see in a minute.</code>
<li><code>header</code> the header content of the menu.  This is optional.
<li><code>content</code> the array containing the menu options.  Here, the simulator expects at least one object, ie the menu should have at least one option.  When displaying the menu options, the simulator automatically populates the menu options labelled from 'a' to 'z'.  In the current version of the simulator the maximum number of permitted options is 26.</li>Each menu sub-object within the <code>menu content</code> property, must have as a minimum the following:
<ul><li><code>type</code> Permitted values are <code>linkStatic</code> or <code>skip</code> (see last bullet).  <code>LinkStatic</code> is a reference to another JSON file.  Therefore, if the type is <code>linkStatic</code>, then a <code>ref</code> property must also be present.
<li><code>ref</code> indicates the JSON file to execute in the event that the user selects this menu option.  So in our case, this menu option will be displayed as <code>a I like red</code>.  If the user selects option a, the simulator will execute the file <code>/profile/red.json</code></li>
<li><code>description</code> this is the menu option text that should be displayed to the user, minus the menu option letter.</li>
<li><code>shortcut</code> is the text that the user can send to select the menu option as an alternative to sending the menu option letter.  So for example, a command of "blue" would cause the simulator to jump to <code>/profile/blue.json</code> as would sending "b" in this case.</li>
<li><code>type skip</code>This is a special value which causes the simulator to pass the context to the next JSON object in the current file.  So in our case, if the user were to select option c (or send 'skip'), the simulator will pass to the end type and execute the <code>#onem</code> menu).</li>
