    <h3>1&nbsp&nbspIntroduction</h3>
    <p>ONEmSimulator is a web-based simulation tool that allows the creation and simulation "semi-static" ONEm services.  The simulator is in no way connected to the ONEm trial or live platforms, it is indended to help the service designer to visualize what the end-service might look like when finally implemented on the ONEm platform "proper".</p>
    <p>The simulator can be used by internal ONEm staff, by mobile operators or by third parties wishing to understand the "look and feel" and "user experience" aspects of ONEm services.</p>
